## Geometric Sketch

To generate the graphs from the paper, use cmake in the cpp folder and run main.py in the python folder.
You need a folder named figures for the output, and a folder named pcaps containing a trace named capture.txt (one key per line).
Remember to set the number of packets to read in main.py's COUNT_PACKET for the figures to be correct.
